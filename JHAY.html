    <h2> Hello, My Name is Jhay Lhord S. Villegas, but you can just call me Jhay for short. I'm 18, turning 19 in July 28, 2023. I was born in Cebu City, and I live in Tunga Sabang Olango Island. Have a younger brother we are only 4 in the family including my Mother and Father. My mother's name is Elvira S. Villegas , and my Father's name is Armando D. Villegas. My Mother's occupation is a sewer and also have a business in Olango which is being taken care of by my Father.<h2>
     
   <h2>  My hobbies are reading, dancing, singing, play guitar and other stuff like learning how to play other instruments. I'm friendly and open for making new friends and I'm also helpful to others, but if I found out that they are taking advantage of me, then better stop because you might not like when I'm angry. I don't like sports but I love sleeping and travel. I like traveling with close friends and love ones. <h2>
     
  <h2>   I have a dream like... alot when sleeping HAHA just kidding, I do have dreams of traveling to other places, I dreamed to be a happy person, not so stress life and stable life.<h2>
